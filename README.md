# USB_APK_Sideloader_CSharp
simple tool made in C# WinForms to Sideload .apk files to a Android Phone via a USB Connection. Basically a GUI frontend for the adb install command. You need .NET Framework 4.6 to use it

Tested working by sideloading Minecraft v0.1.1j Alpha to a HTC Desire running Android 2.2.2
<br> It is intended to make installing apps on old Android phones without SD card and Google Play access easier
